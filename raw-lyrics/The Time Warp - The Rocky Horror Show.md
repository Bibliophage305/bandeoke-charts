# The Time Warp - The Rocky Horror Show

It's astounding\
Time is fleeting\
Madness takes its toll\
But listen closely\
(Oh, not for very much longer)\
I've got to keep control

I remember doing the time-warp\
Drinking those moments when\
The Blackness would hit me\
And the void would be calling

Let's do the time-warp again\
Let's do the time-warp again

It's just a jump to the left\
And then a step to the right\
Put your hands on your hips\
You bring your knees in tight\
But it's the pelvic thrust\
That really drives you insane

Let's do the time-warp again\
Let's do the time-warp again

It's so dreamy, oh fantasy free me\
So you can't see me,\
No, not at all\
In another dimension\
With voyeuristic intention\
Well secluded, I see all

With a bit of a mind flip\
You're into the time slip\
And nothing can ever be the same\
You're spaced out on sensation\
Like you're under sedation

Let's do the time-warp again\
Let's do the time-warp again

Well I was walking down the street\
just a-having a think\
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink\
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise\
He had a pickup truck, and the devil's eyes\
He stared at me and I felt a change\
Time meant nothing, never would again

Let's do the time-warp again\
Let's do the time-warp again

It's just a jump to the left\
And then a step to the right\
Put your hands on your hips\
You bring your knees in tight\
But it's the pelvic thrust\
That really drives you insane

Let's do the time-warp again\
Let's do the time-warp again
