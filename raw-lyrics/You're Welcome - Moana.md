# You're Welcome - Moana

I see what's happening, yeah\
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange\
You don't even know how you feel\
It's adorable!\
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change

Open your eyes, let's begin\
Yes, it's really me\
It's Maui! Breathe it in\
I know it's a lot:\
The hair, the bod!\
When you're staring at a demigod

What can I say except "You're welcome"\
For the tides, the sun, the sky?\
Hey, it's OK, it's OK. You're welcome\
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!

Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky\
When you were waddling yea high?\
This guy!\
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?\
You're looking at him, yo!

Oh, also I lassoed the sun\
—You're welcome—\
To stretch your days and bring you fun\
Also, I harnessed the breeze\
—You're welcome—\
To fill your sails and shake your trees

So what can I say except "You're welcome"\
For the islands I pulled from the sea?\
There's no need to pray, it's OK\
You're welcome\
I guess it's just my way of being me

You're welcome, you're welcome\
Well, come to think of it

Kid, honestly I could go on and on\
I could explain every natural phenomenon\
The tide, the grass, the ground\
Oh, that was Maui just messing around\
I killed an eel, I buried its guts\
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts\
What's the lesson? What is the take-away?\
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the break-away\
And the tapestry here in my skin\
Is a map of the victories I win\
Look where I've been. I make everything happen\
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'!\
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey!

Well, anyway, let me say you're welcome!\
For the wonderful world you know\
Hey, it's OK, it's OK. You're welcome!\
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go

Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome!\
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat\
I'm sailing away, away. You're welcome!\
'Cause Maui can do everything but float\
You're welcome, you're welcome

And thank you!
