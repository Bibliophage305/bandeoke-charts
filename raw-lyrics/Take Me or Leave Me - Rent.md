# Take Me or Leave Me - Rent

[Maureen:]\
Every single day,\
I walk down the street\
I hear people say "Baby," so sweet\
Ever since puberty\
Everybody stares at me\
Boys, girls, I can't help it baby\
So be kind, and don't lose your mind\
Just remember that I'm your baby

Take me for what I am\
Who I was meant to be\
And if you give a damn\
Take me baby, or leave me

Take me baby or leave me

[Maureen:]\
A tiger in a cage\
Can never see the sun\
This diva needs her stage baby, let's have fun!\
You are the one I choose\
Folks would kill to fill your shoes\
You love the lime light too now, baby\
So be mine and don't waste my time\
Cryin' "Oh honey bear are you still my, my, my baby?"

Take me for what I am\
Who I was meant to be\
And if you give a damn\
Take me baby, or leave me

No way, can I be what I'm not\
But hey, don't you want your girl hot?\
Oh, don't fight, don't loose your head\
'Cause every night who's in your bed?\
Who?\
Who's in your bed?\
[Spoken:] Kiss, Pookie.

[Joanne:]\
It won't work\
I look before I leap\
I love margins and discipline\
I make list in my sleep baby\
What's my sin?\
Never quit\
I follow through\
I hate mess but I love you\
What do with my impromptu baby?\
So be wise, 'cause this girl satisfies\
You've got a prize so don't compromise\
You're one lucky baby

[Joanne:] Take me for what I am\
[Maureen:] A control freak.\
[Joanne:] Who I was meant to be\
[Maureen:] A snob, yet overattentive\
[Joanne:] And if you give a damn\
[Maureen:] A lovable troll geek\
[Joanne:] Take me baby, or leave me\
[Maureen:] An anal retentive!

[Both:] That's it!\
[Joanne:] The straw that breaks my back\
[Both:] I quit!\
[Joanne:] Unless you take it back\
[Maureen:] Women! What is it about them?\
[Both:] Can't live with them or without them!

[Chorus:]\
[Both:] Take me for what I am\
[Joanne:] Who I was meant to be\
[Maureen:] Who I was meant to be\
And if you give a damn\
[Joanne:] And if you give a damn you better\
Take me baby, or leave me\
[Maureen:] Oh, take me baby! Take me or lea-yea-yeave me\
[Both:] Take me babay-ay-ay! Or leave me\
[Spoken:] Guess I'm leaving. I'm gone!
