# Surrender - Cheap Trick

Mother told me, yes, she told me\
I'd meet girls like you\
She also told me, "Stay away\
You'll never know what you'll catch"\
Just the other day I heard\
Of a soldier's falling off\
Some Indonesian junk\
That's going 'round

Mommy's alright\
Daddy's alright\
They just seem a little weird\
Surrender\
Surrender\
But don't give yourself away\
Hey, hey

Father says, "Your mother's right\
She's really up on things\
Before we married, Mommy served\
In the WACS in the Philippines"\
Now, I had heard the WACs recruited\
Old maids for the war\
But mommy isn't one of those\
I've known her all these years

Mommy's alright\
Daddy's alright\
They just seem a little weird\
Surrender\
Surrender\
But don't give yourself away\
Hey, hey

Whatever happened to all this season's\
Losers of the year?\
Every time I got to thinking\
Where'd they disappear?\
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad\
Are rolling on the couch\
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin'\
Got my KISS records out

Mommy's alright\
Daddy's alright\
They just seem a little weird\
Surrender\
Surrender\
But don't give yourself away\
Hey, hey\
Away\
Away
