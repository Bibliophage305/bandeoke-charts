# Werewolves of London - Warren Zevon

I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand\
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain\
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's\
Going to get a big dish of beef chow mein\
Werewolves of London

If you hear him howling around your kitchen door\
Better not let him in\
Little old lady got mutilated late last night\
Werewolves of London again\
Werewolves of London

He's the hairy handed gent who ran amuck in Kent\
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair\
Better stay away from him\
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim\
I'd like to meet his tailor\
Werewolves of London

Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen\
Doing the werewolves of London\
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen\
Doing the werewolves of London\
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's\
His hair was perfect\
Werewolves of London again\
Draw blood
