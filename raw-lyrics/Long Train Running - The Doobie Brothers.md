# Long Train Running - The Doobie Brothers

Down around the corner\
A half a mile from here\
You see them long trains runnin'\
And you watch them disappear

Without love\
Where would you be now\
Without love

You know I saw Miss Lucy\
Down along the tracks\
She lost her home and her family\
And she won't be comin' back

Without love\
Where would you be right now\
Without love

Well the Illinois Central\
And the Southern Central Freight\
Gotta keep on pushin' Mama\
'Cause you know they're runnin' late

Without love\
Where would you be now - now, now, now\
Without love

[Instrumental]

Well the Illinois Central\
And the Southern Central Freight\
Gotta keep on pushin' Mama\
You know they're runnin' late

Without love\
Where would you be now\
Without love

When pistons keep on churnin'\
And the wheels go 'round and 'round\
And the steel rails lie cold and hard\
For the miles that they go down

Without love\
Where would you be right now\
Without love

Where would you be now

Gotta get ya, baby, baby\
Won't you boogie down?\
Won't you boogie down?

Baby, baby, baby, baby\
Won't you boogie down?

Where the big trains run\
When the trains are movin' on

Ya gotta keep on movin'\
Keep on movin'\
Keep on movin'\
Won't ya keep on movin'
