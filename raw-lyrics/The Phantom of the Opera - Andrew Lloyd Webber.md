# The Phantom of the Opera - Andrew Lloyd Webber

[CHRISTINE]\
In sleep, he sang to me, in dreams he came\
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name\
And do I dream again? For now, I find\
The Phantom of the Opera is there\
Inside my mind

[PHANTOM]\
Sing once again with me, our strange duet\
My power over you grows stronger yet\
And though you turn from me to glance behind\
The Phantom of the Opera is there\
Inside your mind

[CHRISTINE]\
Those who have seen your face\
Draw back in fear\
I am the mask you wear

[PHANTOM]\
It's me they hear…

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]\
Your spirit and my voice\
My spirit and your voice

[CHRISTINE & PHANTOM]\
In one combined\
The Phantom of the Opera is there

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]\
Inside my mind\
Inside your mind

[ENSEMBLE]\
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera\
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera

[PHANTOM]\
In all your fantasies, you always knew\
That man and mystery

[CHRISTINE]\
Were both in you

[CHRISTINE & PHANTOM]\
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]\
The Phantom of the Opera is here\
The Phantom of the Opera is there\
Inside my mind…\
Inside your mind…\
[PHANTOM]\
Sing, my Angel of Music!

[CHRISTINE]\
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

[CHRISTINE vocalizing]

[PHANTOM]\
Sing!\
Sing for me\
Sing, my Angel of Music!\
Sing for me!
