# Totally Gay - Big Mouth

(What's it like to be gay?)

When you're gay\
Every day is a nonstop cabaret\
You've got style and flair, you're loved everywhere\
'Cept for North Carolina!

Bears and queens, and Catholic tweens\
The world's your buff buffet\
Come and join in the fun, say hello to tight buns\
And goodbye vaginas

[Optional extra verse]\
Today, come be gay (so gay!)\
Not just by ephemer-a ti fa ti ve\
But genuinely gay\
There's a new life calling

Be gay, totally gay (be gay!)\
Be a bright and shining rainbow\
Yes, you'll find your new identity\
In the LGBT community\
Oh

I'm gay, totally gay! (he's gay!)\
I'm a fabulous, flouncing loud and proud cliché (sashay!)\
On display (all day!)\
And I've found my calling

Today (hooray!) oh, shanté (so gay!)\
It's a flaming hot pink letter day\
I'm not the boy I used to be\
I'm here, I'm queer\
Get used to me

(He's absolutely, undeniably gay)
