# Hold Me While You Wait - Lewis Capaldi

I'm waiting up, saving all my precious time\
Losing light, I'm missing my same old us\
Before we learned our truth too late\
Resigned to fate, fading away

So tell me, can you turn around?\
I need someone to tear me down\
Oh tell me, can you turn around?\
But either way

Hold me while you wait\
I wish that I was good enough \
(Hold me while you wait)\
If only I could wake you up \
(Hold me while you wait)\
My love, my love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while? \
(Hold me while you wait)

Tell me more, tell me something I don't know\
Did we come close to havin' it all?\
If you're gonna waste my time\
Let's waste it right

And hold me while you wait\
I wish that I was good enough \
(Hold me while you wait)\
If only I could wake you up \
(Hold me while you wait)\
My love, my love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while? \
(Hold me while you wait)

I wish you cared a little more \
(Hold me while you wait)\
I wish you'd told me this before \
(Hold me while you wait)\
My love, my love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while? \
(Hold me while you wait)

This is you, this is me, this is all we need\
Is it true? My faith is shaken, but I still believe\
This is you, this is me, this is all we need\
So won't you stay a while?

And hold me while you wait\
I wish that I was good enough \
(Hold me while you wait)\
If only I could wake you up \
(Hold me while you wait)\
My love, my love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while? \
(Hold me while you wait)

I wish you cared a little more \
(Hold me while you wait)\
I wish you'd told me this before \
(Hold me while you wait)\
My love, my love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while? \
(Hold me while you wait)

(This is you, this is me, this is all we need)\
Stay a while \
(Hold me while you wait)\
(Is it true? My faith is shaken, but I still believe)\
Stay a while \
(Hold me while you wait)\
(This is you, this is me, this is all we need)\
My love, my love, my love\
Won't you stay a while?
