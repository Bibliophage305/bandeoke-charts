# Livin' La Vida Loca - Ricky Martin

She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls\
I feel a premonition that girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations new kicks in the candle light\
She's got a new addiction for every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain\
She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain\
Like a bullet to your brain\
Come on!

Upside, inside out she's living la vida loca\
She'll push and pull you down, living la vida loca\
Her lips are devil-red and her skin's the color mocha\
She will wear you out living la vida loca\
Come on!\
Living la vida loca\
Come on!\
She's living la vida loca

Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel\
She took my heart and she took my money\
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water\
Makes you order French Champagne\
Once you've had a taste of her\
You'll never be the same\
Yeah, she'll make you go insane\
Alright

Upside, inside out she's living la vida loca\
She'll push and pull you down, living la vida loca\
Her lips are devil-red and her skin's the color mocha\
She will wear you out living la vida loca\
Alright!\
Living la vida loca\
She's living la vida loca

She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain\
She'll make you live her crazy life\
But she'll take away your pain\
Like a bullet to your brain\
Come on!

Upside, inside out she's living la vida loca\
She'll push and pull you down, living la vida loca\
Her lips are devil-red and her skin's the color mocha\
She will wear you out living la vida loca\
Come on!

Upside, inside out she's living la vida loca\
She'll push and pull you down, living la vida loca\
Her lips are devil-red and her skin's the color mocha\
She will wear you out living la vida loca\
Come on!\
Living la vida loca\
Come on!\
She's living la vida loca

Come on!

Come on!\
La vida loca\
La vida loca\
La vi
