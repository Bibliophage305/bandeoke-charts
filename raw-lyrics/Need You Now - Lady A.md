# Need You Now - Lady A

*Female*\
Picture perfect memories\
Scattered all around the floor\
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind\
For me, it happens all the time

*Both*\
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now\
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now\
And I don't know how I can do without\
I just need you now

*Male*\
Another shot of whiskey\
Can't stop lookin' at the door\
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind\
For me, it happens all the time

*Both*\
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now\
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now\
And I don't know how I can do without\
I just need you now\
Whoa, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

*Female*\
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now\
*Male*\
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now\
*Both*\
And I don't know how I can do without\
I just need you now

I just need you now\
Oh baby, I need you now
