# All Night Long (All Night) - Lionel Richie

Well, my friends, the time has come\
To raise the roof and have some fun\
Throw away the work to be done\
Let the music play on\
(Play on, play on)

Everybody sing, everybody dance\
Lose yourself in wild romance\
We're going to party\
Karamu, fiesta, forever\
Come on and sing along!

We're going to party\
Karamu, fiesta, forever\
Come on and sing along!

All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)

People dancing all in the street\
See the rhythm all in their feet\
Life is good, wild and sweet\
Let the music play on\
(Play on, play on)

Feel it in your heart\
And feel it in your soul\
Let the music take control\
We're going to party\
Liming, fiesta, forever\
Come on and sing my song!

All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)

Yeah, once you get started\
You can't sit down\
Come join the fun\
It's a merry-go-round\
Everyone's dancing\
Their troubles away\
Come join our party\
See how we play!

Way to party oh we're going, oh jambali\
Tam bo li de, say de moi ya. Yeah jambo jambo

Oh, yes\
We're gonna have a party!

All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)\
All night long! (all night, all night)

Everyone you meet\
They're jamming in the street\
All night long!\
Yeah, I said\
Everyone you meet\
They're jamming in the street\
All night long!

Be good! Feel good!
