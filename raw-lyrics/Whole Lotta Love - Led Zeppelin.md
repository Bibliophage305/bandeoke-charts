# Whole Lotta Love - Led Zeppelin

You need cooling, baby, I'm not fooling\
I'm gonna send you back to schooling\
Way down inside, honey, you need it\
I'm gonna give you my love\
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love

You've been learning, baby, I've been yearning\
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learning\
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it\
I'm gonna give you my love\
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love

You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling\
All the good times baby I've been misusing\
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love\
I'm gonna give you every inch of my love\
Gonna give you my love

Yeah! All right! Let's go

Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love\
Want a whole lotta love

Way down inside... woman... you need... love

Shake for me, girl\
I wanna be your backdoor man\
Keep it cooling, baby\
Keep it cooling, baby\
Keep it cooling, baby\
Keep it cooling, baby
