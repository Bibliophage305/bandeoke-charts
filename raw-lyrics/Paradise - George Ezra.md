# Paradise - George Ezra

My love (my love)\
My lover, lover, lover\
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you\
My mind (my mind)\
My m-m-m-m-mind\
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you\
Ride on (ride on)\
I will ride on down the road\
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there\
It's long (how long?)\
Well it's a mighty long road\
But I'll find you, I will hold you and I'll be there

I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and\
I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way

My time (my time)\
My t-t-t-t-time\
Well it's a never ending helter skelter\
We'll be out whatever the weather\
My heart (my heart)\
My boom-boom heart\
It's a beat and it's a thumping\
And I'm alive

I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and\
I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way

Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on\
Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on\
Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on\
Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on\
Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on\
Paradise, roll on roll on\
Meet me there, hold on hold on

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way

I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and\
I know you heard it from those other boys\
But this time it's real\
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way\
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins\
You know it's love heading your way
