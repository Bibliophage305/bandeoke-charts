# Reach - S Club 7

When the world leaves you feeling blue\
You can count on me. I will be there for you\
When it seems all your hopes and dreams\
Are a million miles away. I will re-assure you

We've got to all stick together\
Good friends are there for each other\
Never ever forget\
That I've got you and you've got me

So, reach for the stars\
Climb every mountain higher\
Reach for the stars\
Follow your heart's desire\
Reach for the stars\
And when that rainbow's shining over you\
That's when your dreams will all come true

There's a place waiting just for you\
It's a special place where your dreams all come true\
Fly away, swim the ocean blue\
Drive that open road, leave the past behind you

Don't stop. Gotta keep moving\
Your hopes have gotta keep building\
Never ever forget\
That I've got you and you've got me

So, reach for the stars\
Climb every mountain higher\
Reach for the stars\
Follow your heart's desire\
Reach for the stars\
And when that rainbow's shining over you\
That's when your dreams will all come true

Don't believe in all that you've been told\
The sky's the limit. You can reach your goal\
No-one knows just what the future holds\
There ain't nothing you can't be\
There's a whole world at your feet\
I said reach

Climb every mountain\
Reach\
Reach for the moon\
Reach\
Follow that rainbow\
And your dreams will all come true

Reach for the stars\
Climb every mountain higher\
Reach for the stars\
Follow your heart's desire\
Reach for the stars\
And when that rainbow's shining over you\
That's when your dreams will all come true

Reach for the stars\
Climb every mountain higher\
Reach for the stars\
Follow your heart's desire\
Reach for the stars\
And when that rainbow's shining over you\
That's when your dreams will all come true
