# Mary On A Cross - Ghost

We were speeding together\
Down the dark avenues\
But besides all the stardom\
All we got was blues\
But through all the sorrow\
We've been riding high\
And the truth of the matter is\
I never let you go, let you go

We were scanning the cities\
Rocking to pay their dues\
But besides all the glamor\
All we got was bruised\
But through all the sorrow\
We've been riding high\
And the truth of the matter is\
I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary\
Mary on a, Mary on a cross\
Not just another bloody Mary\
Mary on a, Mary on a cross\
If you choose to run away with me\
I will tickle you internally\
And I see nothing wrong with that

We were searching for reasons\
To play by the rules\
But we quickly found out\
It was just for fools\
Now through all the sorrow\
We'll be riding high\
And the truth of the matter is\
I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary\
Mary on a, Mary on a cross\
Not just another bloody Mary\
Mary on a, Mary on a...

You go down just like Holy Mary\
Mary on a, Mary on a cross\
Your beauty never, ever scared me\
Mary on a, Mary on a cross\
If you choose to run away with me\
I will tickle you internally\
And I see nothing wrong with that

(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)\
Nothing wrong with that\
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)\
Nothing wrong with that\
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)\
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
