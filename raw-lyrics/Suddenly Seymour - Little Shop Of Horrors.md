# Suddenly Seymour - Little Shop Of Horrors

[Seymour]\
Lift up your head\
Wash off your mascara\
Here, take my Kleenex\
Wipe that lipstick away\
Show me your face, clean as the mornin'\
I know things were bad, but now they're okay

Suddenly Seymour is standin' beside you\
You don't need no makeup, don't have to pretend\
Suddenly Seymour is here to provide you\
Sweet understanding\
Seymour's your friend

[AUDREY]\
Nobody ever treated me kindly\
Daddy left early\
Mama was poor\
I'd meet a man and I'd follow him blindly\
He'd snap his fingers\
Me, I'd say "sure."

Suddenly Seymour is standin' beside me\
He don't give me orders\
He don't condescend\
Suddenly Seymour is here to provide me\
Sweet understanding\
Seymour's my friend

[SEYMOUR]\
Tell me this feelin'll last till forever\
Tell me the bad times are clean washed away

[AUDREY]\
Please understand that it's still strange and fright'nin'\
For losers like I've been it's so hard to say

[AUDREY]\
Suddenly Seymour,\
He purified me\
Suddenly Seymour\
He showed me I can\
Learn how to be more\
The girl that's inside me\
With sweet understanding,\
With sweet understanding,\
With sweet understanding,\
Seymour's my man!

[SEYMOUR] [Audrey] [Company]\
Suddenly Seymour,\
He purified you\
Suddenly Seymour\
Yes, you can\
Learn how to be more\
The girl that's inside you\
With sweet understanding,\
With sweet understanding,\
With sweet understanding,\
Seymour's your man
