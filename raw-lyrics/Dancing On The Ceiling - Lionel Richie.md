# Dancing On The Ceiling - Lionel Richie

What is happening here?\
Something's going on\
That's not quite clear\
Somebody turn on the lights\
We're gonna have a party\
It's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Room is hot and that's good\
Some of my friends came by from the neighbourhood\
People were starting to climb the walls\
Ooh, it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Come on

Everybody starts to lose control\
When the music is right\
If you see somebody hanging around\
Don't get uptight

The only thing we wanna do tonight\
Is go round and round\
And turn upside down\
Come on, let's get down

So come on, let's get loose\
Don't hold back\
'Cause it ain't no use\
Hard to keep your feet on the ground\
'Cause when we like to party\
We only wanna get down

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling, baby\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

What? You say what?\
Can't stop now\
Just get started\
Everybody, clap your hands\
Come on

Everybody, let's dance

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling\
Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling\
When we're dancing on the ceiling, baby, baby

We wanna dance all night
