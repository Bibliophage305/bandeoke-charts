# Forget You - CeeLo Green

I see you driving 'round town\
With the girl I love\
And I'm like forget you!\
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough\
I'm like forget you!\
And forget her too!

Said, if I was richer,\
I'd still be with ya\
Ha, now ain't that some shit?\
(ain't that some shit?)\
And although there's pain in my chest\
I still wish you the best\
With a forget you!

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari,\
But that don't mean I can't get you there.\
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari,\
About the way you play your game ain't fair.

I pity the fool that falls in love with you\
(Oops she's a gold digger)\
Well\
(Just thought you should know nigga)\
I've got some news for you\
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town\
With the girl I love\
And I'm like forget you!\

I'd still be with ya\
Ha, now ain't that some shit?\
(ain't that some shit?)\
And although there's pain in my chest\
I still wish you the best\
With a forget you!

Now I know that I had to borrow,\
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.\
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya.\
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap.
