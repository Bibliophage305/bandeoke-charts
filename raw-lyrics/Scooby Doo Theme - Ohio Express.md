# Scooby Doo Theme - Ohio Express

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You?\
We got some work to do now.\
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You?\
We need some help from you now.

Come on Scooby-Doo, I see you... pretending you got a sliver\
But you're not fooling me, cause I can see, the way you shake and shiver.

You know we got a mystery to solve,\
So Scooby Doo be ready for your act.\
Don't hold back!\
And Scooby Doo if you come through\
you're going to have yourself a scooby snack!\
That's a fact!

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, here Are You.\
You're ready and you're willing.\
If we can count on you Scooby Doo,\

I know you'll catch that villian.
