# That Don't Impress Me Much - Shania Twain

Ow\
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart\
But you've got being right down to an art\
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall\
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're special\
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

OK, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much\
So you got the brains but have you got the touch?\
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright\
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket\
And a comb up his sleeve just in case\
And all that extra-hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it\
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're special\
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

OK, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uh)\
So you got the looks but have you got the touch?\
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright\
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much

Yeah

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine\
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in\
I can't believe you kiss your car good night\
Now, c'mon, baby, tell me? You must be jokin', right?

Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something special\
Oh-ooh-oh, you think you're something else

OK, so you've got a car

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uh)\
So you got the moves but have you got the touch?\
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright\
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much (That don't impress me)\
You think you're cool but have you got the touch?\
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright\
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night

That don't impress me much\
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

OK. So, what do you think? You're Elvis or something?

Whatever

That don't impress me
