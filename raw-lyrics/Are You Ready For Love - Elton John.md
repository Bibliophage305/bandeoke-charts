# Are You Ready For Love - Elton John

Catch a star if you can\
Wish for somethin' special\
Let it be me, my love is free

Sing a song to yourself\
Think of someone listenin'\
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me\
If you let me love you\
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see\
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?

You're the one like the sun\
Shine your love around me\
You'll always be the one for me

Say the word, I'll be there\
Lovin' you forever\
Don't let me go, just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops\
To the valley below us\
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby\
So the angels will know us, angels will know us

Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?

Yes I am\
Yes I am\
Yes I am\
Yes I am\
Yes I am

Oh, are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you\
Are you ready, are you ready for love?\
Yes I am, are you
