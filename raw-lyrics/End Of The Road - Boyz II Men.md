# End Of The Road - Boyz II Men

We belong together\
And you know that I'm right\
Why do you play with my heart?\
Why do you play with my mind?\
Said we'd be forever\
Said it'd never die\
How could you love me and leave me\
And never say good-bye?

Oh I can't sleep at night without holding you tight\
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry\
The pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead\
Spinnin' it around and around

Although we've come\
To the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me\
You just don't realize\
You've never been there before\
It's only your first time\
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm\
Maybe you'll try\
We should be happy together\
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?\
This time I want you to love me much more\
This time instead just come to my bed\
And baby, just don't let me, oh

Although we've come\
To the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you\
Come to the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you

Lonely (Lonely)\
So-oh-oh-oh... (Lonely)\
Lonely (Lonely)\
(Oh!)

This time instead\
Just come to my bed\
And baby, just don't let me down

Although we've come\
To the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you\
Come to the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you\
Come to the end of the road\
Still I can't let go\
It's unnatural\
You belong to me\
I belong to you
