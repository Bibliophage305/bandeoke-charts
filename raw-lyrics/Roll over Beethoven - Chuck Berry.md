# Roll over Beethoven - Chuck Berry

Well I'm-a write a little letter\
I'm gonna mail it to my local D.J.\
Yes, it's a jumpin' little record\
I want my jockey to play\
Roll over Beethoven\
I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature risin'\
And the jukebox blowin' a fuse\
My heart beatin' rhythm\
And my soul keep a-singing the blues\
Roll over Beethoven\
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia\
I need a shot of rhythm and blues\
I caught the rollin' arthritis\
Sittin' down at a rhythm review\
Roll over Beethoven\
They rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it\
Go get your lover then reel and rock it\
Roll it over then move on up just a trifle further\
Then reel and rock with one another\
Roll over Beethoven\
And dig these rhythm and blues

Well early in the mornin'\
And I'm givin' you my warnin'\
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes\
Hey diddle-diddle, I'm-a play my fiddle\
Ain't got nothing to lose\
Roll over Beethoven\
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggle like a glow worm\
Dance like a spinnin' top\
She got a crazy partner\
You oughta see him reel and rock\
Long as she got a dime\
The music won't never stop

Roll over Beethoven\
Roll over Beethoven\
Roll over Beethoven\
Roll over Beethoven\
Roll over Beethoven\
And dig these rhythm and blues
