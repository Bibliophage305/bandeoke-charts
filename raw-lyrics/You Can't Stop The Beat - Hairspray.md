# You Can't Stop The Beat - Hairspray

[Tracy:]\
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill\
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will\
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still

Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round\
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound\
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Tracy/Link:]\
Cause you can't stop the beat\
Ever since this whole world began\
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man\
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today

Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky\
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why\
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say\
That you can't stop the beat

[Penny:]\
You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea

[Seaweed:]\
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be

[Penny:]\
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed

[Penny/Seaweed:]\
I'll call the NAACP

[Penny:]\
Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Seaweed:]\
'Round and 'round

[Penny:]\
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound

[Seaweed:]\
Speed of sound, yeah

[Penny:]\
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Penny/Seaweed:]\
Cause you can't stop the beat\
Ever since we first saw the light\
A man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night\
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today

Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above\
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of\
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay\
Cause you can't stop the beat

[Edna:]\
You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am\
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas ham\
So if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn

Cause the world\
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Company:]\
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Edna:]\
And my heart's\
Keeping time to the speed of sound

[Company:]\
Keeping time to the speed of sound

[Edna:]\
I was lost\
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Company:]\
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Edna/Company:]\
Cause you can't stop the beat\
Ever since this whole world began\
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man\
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today

Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky\
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why\
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye\
And say

[Edna:]\
That you can't stop the beat

[Motormouth:]\
Oh, oh, oh, you can't stop today

[Company:]\
No

[Motormouth:]\
As it comes speeding down the track

[Company:]\
Ooh

[Motormouth:]\
Child, yesterday is history and it's never coming back\
Cause

Tomorrow is a\
Brand new day

[Company:]\
Tomorrow\
Brand new day

[Motormouth:]\
And it don't know white from black

[Company:]\
Yeah

[Motormouth:]\
Cause the world\
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Company:]\
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Motormouth:]\
And my heart's\
Keeping time to the speed of sound

[Company:]\
Keeping time to the speed of sound

[Motormouth:]\
I was lost\
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Company:]\
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[Motormouth/Company:]\
Cause you can't stop the beat\
Ever since we first saw the light\
A man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night\
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today

Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above\
They can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of\
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay\
Cause you can't stop the beat

[Full Company:]\
Ever since we first saw the sun\
A man and woman liked to shake it when the day is done\
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun for today

You can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above\
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of\
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay

You can't stop the beat\
You can't stop the beat\
You can't stop the beat\
You can't stop the beat\
You can't stop the beat
