# The Bare Necessities - The Jungle Book

[Chorus: Baloo]\
Look for the bare necessities\
The simple bare necessities\
Forget about your worries and your strife\
I mean the bare necessities\
Old Mother Nature's recipes\
That bring the bare necessities of life

[Verse 1: Baloo]\
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam\
I couldn't be fonder of my big home\
The bees are buzzin' in the tree\
To make some honey just for me\
When you look under the rocks and plants\
And take a glance at the fancy ants\
Then maybe try a few

[Skit: Baloo, Mowgli & Bagheera]\
You eat ants?\
Hahaha, you gotta believe it\
And you're gonna love the way they tickle\
Mowgli, look out!

[Pre-Chorus: Baloo & Mowgli]\
The bare necessities of life will come to you (When?)\
They'll come to you

[Chorus: Baloo]\
Look for the bare necessities\
The simple bare necessities\
Forget about your worries and your strife\
I mean the bare necessities\
That's why a bear can rest at ease\
With just the bare necessities of life

[Verse 2: Baloo & Mowgli]\
Now when you pick a pawpaw\
Or a prickly pear (Ow!)\
And you prick a raw paw\
Well, next time beware\
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw\
When you pick a pear\
Try to use the claw\
But you don't need to use the claw\
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw\
Have I given you a clue?\
(Golly, thanks Baloo!)

[Skit: Bagheera & Baloo]\
Paw-paw, ha! Of all the silly gibberish\
C'mon Baggy, get with the beat!

[Pre-Chorus: Baloo & Mowgli]\
The bare necessities of life will come to you\
(They'll come to me!)\
They'll come to you

[Interlude: Baloo & Mowgli]\
How about scratchin' that ol' left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?\
Now just a hair lower.. There, right there. That's it. Ahh..\
This is beautiful. That's good. Kid, we've got to get to a tree\
This calls for some big scratch!\
You're lots of fun, Baloo!\
Right on it.. Yeah! That's delicious! Oh, ooo! Just a little bit--\
Mmm.. yeah.. ha-ha.. ooo\
Mm... mmm... ha-ha.. ooo. yeah!\
Oh man, this is really livin'

[Bridge: Baloo]\
So just try and relax, yeah, cool it\
Fall apart in my backyard\
'Cause let me tell you something, little britches\
If you act like that bee acts, uh-uh\
You're working too hard\
And don't spend your time lookin' around\
For something you want that can't be found\
When you find out you can live without it\
And go along not thinkin' about it\
I'll tell you something true\
The bare necessities of life will come to you

[Skit: Bagheera & Baloo]\
Ahh.. I give up. Well I hope his luck holds out\
Mowgli, how 'bout you singing?

[Chorus: Baloo, Mowgli & Both]\
Look for the bare necessities\
The simple bare necessities\
Forget about your worries and your strife\
(Yeah, man!)\
I mean the bare necessities\
Old Mother Nature's recipes\
That bring the bare necessities of life\
(Yeah!)\
With just the bare necessities of life\
Yeah, man!
